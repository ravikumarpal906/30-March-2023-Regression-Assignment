When alpha = 0, the penalty is equivalent to Ridge regression. When alpha = 1, the penalty is equivalent to Lasso regression.\n","\n","# Compared to other regression techniques:\n","\n","# - Ridge Regression: Elastic Net is similar to Ridge regression in that it penalizes the sum of squared coefficients. However, Elastic Net also includes an L1 penalty, which encourages sparsity (i.e., some coefficients can be zero). This makes Elastic Net more robust to multicollinearity and can help to prevent overfitting.\n","\n","# - Lasso Regression: Elastic Net is similar to Lasso regression in that it penalizes the sum of absolute values of coefficients. However, Elastic Net also includes an L2 penalty, which helps to stabilize the model and prevent overfitting.\n","\n","# - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression: OLS regression does not include any regularization terms. This means that it is more susceptible to overfitting when the number of features is large.\n","\n","# Overall, Elastic Net Regression is a versatile and powerful regression technique that can be used to address a wide range of problems. It offers a balance between the strengths of L1 and L2 regularization, making it a good choice for situations where sparsity and stability are both important.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XEKsQCF1PWRI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719417022901,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Kumar Pal","userId":"07351150463644468966"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.
